Here's how the food price prediction model works, explained with everyday examples:

Training Data & Features:
- Like learning from historical grocery receipts
- Features are like shopping factors: season (month), location (country), events (disasters)
- Example: Model learns beef prices rise more during droughts than bread prices

Model Type (SDCA - Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent):
- Regression model: Predicts continuous values (prices) vs classification (categories)
- Like a smart calculator that weighs multiple factors
- Example: Drought (0.5 severity) + Meat category (1.8x multiplier) = Higher price increase

Let me explain SDCA like we're learning algebra in middle school:

Think of SDCA as a way to find the best answer by making small improvements one step at a time.

Example with Math Test Scores:
Let's say we want to predict if students will pass a math test based on:
- Hours studied
- Previous test scores

Step 1: Start with Initial Guess
- Give each factor a weight of 0
- Weight for hours studied = 0
- Weight for previous score = 0

Step 2: Look at One Student at a Time
Sally's data:
- Studied 3 hours
- Previous score: 85
- Actually passed the test

Our prediction would be:
```
Prediction = (0 × 3) + (0 × 85) = 0
```
This is wrong! We need to adjust.

Step 3: Make Small Adjustment
Update weight for hours studied:
```
New weight = 0.2
Prediction = (0.2 × 3) + (0 × 85) = 0.6
```

Step 4: Keep Going Student by Student
Next student (Tom):
- Studied 2 hours
- Previous score: 90
- Actually failed

Update weights again:
```
Hours studied weight = 0.2
Previous score weight = -0.1
Prediction = (0.2 × 2) + (-0.1 × 90) = -8.6
```

Key Ideas:
1. Look at one student at a time (that's the "Stochastic" part)
2. Adjust one weight at a time (that's the "Coordinate" part)
3. Try to make each adjustment improve our predictions
4. Keep repeating until our predictions get good enough

This is much simpler than trying to find the perfect weights all at once!

SDCA is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning, particularly for training linear classifiers and regression models. Here's the key math explained simply:

The Problem:
We want to minimize a function f(w) = λR(w) + 1/n * Σᵢ lᵢ(w)
where:
- w is the model parameters
- R(w) is a regularization term
- lᵢ(w) is the loss for the i-th training example
- λ is the regularization parameter
- n is the number of training examples

The Algorithm:
1. Instead of working with the primal problem (finding w), SDCA solves the dual problem:
   - Each training example gets a dual variable αᵢ
   - These dual variables indirectly determine w

2. In each iteration:
   - Pick a random training example i
   - Update only its dual variable αᵢ while keeping others fixed
   - The update maximizes the dual objective for that coordinate

Simple Example:
Consider binary classification with hinge loss:
```python
# Primal variables (w)
w = [0, 0]  # Initial weights

# Dual variables (α), one per training example
α = [0, 0, 0]  # For 3 training examples

# In each iteration:
for t in range(iterations):
    i = random.randint(0, 2)  # Pick random example
    # Update αᵢ to maximize dual objective
    # w gets automatically updated through dual relationship
```

The key advantage is that each iteration is very cheap computationally since we're only updating one coordinate at a time, making it efficient for large datasets.


Feature Processing:
1. Normalization
   - Converts different scales to same range (0-1)
   - Example: Converting $2.80 bread and $12.50 beef to comparable scales

2. One-Hot Encoding
   - Converts categories to numbers
   - Example: Meat=1, Dairy=0, Grain=0

Training Process:
1. Pattern Recognition
   - Learns relationships like "droughts affect meat prices more"
   - Similar to a grocery manager learning seasonal patterns

2. Model Evaluation
   - R² (accuracy): How well predictions match actual prices
   - RMSE (error margin): Average prediction error in dollars

Prediction:
- Takes new situation (user input)
- Applies learned patterns
- Example: If drought affected beef +30% historically, applies similar adjustment to new predictions

Here's how the transformer pipeline works in our food price model:

Pipeline Stages:
1. CopyColumns Transform
```csharp
.Append(mlContext.Transforms.CopyColumns(outputColumnName: "Label", inputColumnName: "Price"))
```
- Creates target variable (price) for training

2. Categorical Encoding
```csharp
.Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding(outputColumnName: "FoodItemEncoded", inputColumnName: "FoodItem"))
```
- Converts text to numbers (Beef → [1,0,0], Chicken → [0,1,0])
- Essential for ML algorithms that only work with numbers

3. Numeric Feature Scaling
```csharp
.Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax("MonthNorm", "Month"))
```
- Scales values to 0-1 range
- Example: Month 1-12 → 0.08-1.0

4. Feature Concatenation
```csharp
.Append(mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "FoodItemEncoded", ...))
```
- Combines all processed features into single array
- Like organizing grocery factors into one spreadsheet row

The transformer pipeline prepares raw data into format suitable for ML training, similar to preparing ingredients before cooking.
